# PANDEMONIUM

* Trello available at [https://trello.com/b/FjleDUU4/pandemonium](https://trello.com/b/FjleDUU4/pandemonium)

## Requirements
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install pygame-ce (or other libraries we might add later)

## How to run
To run the singleplayer mode (for demonstration purposes), run the `pandemonium.py` file and make sure `multiplayer` is set to `False`. Press `space` to spawn an enemy at a random position.
